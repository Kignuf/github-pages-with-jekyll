# Not every app is written in the same language

## Intro

This is a short intro to a book concept I'd like to pitch, and if enough people show interest, write.

## The core idea

In this book I will describe how as a developper I came to realize how investing into so called soft or human skills allowed me not only to become a better developper, but a better version of myself.

I will explain how I came to understand how inefficient, if not blatantly counter-productive, generic advices can be and focus my efforts on conveying how you can build your own set of personnal intuitive tools to guide you through the challenges of life.

As this method is based on a fondamental change, a shift, in the way you might be perceiving yourself and the world, it will require you to open your mind to new and uncomfortable ideas, confront your fears and venture into the unknown. Ultimately the invitation is to let go of limiting beliefs and willfully choose a new set of positive ones that will better support your growth.

Following this path can be frightening and hasardous and is not recommanded for everyone depending on where you are in life right now. I will do my best to highlight the most common traps, but be aware that by its very nature the content of this book can lead you astray for a little while and that is both expected and fine. After all, why not have a bit of fun along the way ?

## The Inception

### A story
On the 19th of December 1993 (9 years old) in the evening I went to bed, shut the light off and fell asleep only to experience the worst nightmare I ever had in my life. The next day I was ill and missed school.

My mother accompanied me to the pediatrician which reassured me it was just a cold and prescribed some basic drugs to help recover.

Exactly one year later on the 19th of December 1994 I experienced the exact same nightmare and woke up ill as well. I remember telling the pediatrician that I hadn't seen him for exactly one year, but he didn't pick up on that.

The next year I went to bed, drank some water, shut the light off and closed my eyes. Quickly I could feel the nightmare coming again. However this time I realized what was going on and turned the light on. I spent the next 30 minutes trying different combinations of lights on/off, lying in the bed / sitting in the bed and eyes open / closed.

Eventually I managed to teach myself to fall asleep and not experience the nightmare. The next day I woke up fresh and well, but convinced that hadn't I managed to avoid the nightmare I would be visiting the pediatrician again ..

### Why this story ?
I chose this story because it exhibits a couple of fundamental points:
- It was terrifying
- Despite having tried to talk about it, I never felt understood about how scary and eery it was. It seemed adults didn't really get it and often were downplaying it.
- Ultimately only I could face the nightmare, alone
- I taught myself how to approach the situation and solve it
- It is a personnal and intimate story

### Ok ..
Alright, I get a feeling some of you might feel a bit lost.. I started talking about becoming a better developper and end up writting about a weird childhood nightmare story.

Even if you feel confused, please hold on and follow these instructions:
- Breathe
- No really, breathe in and out fully, do it 3 times or until you feel that's enough
- Did you have thoughts ? Which ones ? Write them somewhere no matter if you judge them to be good or bad

Throughout my life I experienced many events that exhibited many of the characteristics mentionned above. For instance I confronted the fear of being a fraud by opening my first PR on an open source project.

Looking back at my life I can see more clearly now how exploring a vast array of topics and practices helped me open up my mind more and more to other people and ideas, and grow as a person. I have not built the invaluable ability to approach any idea or person and simply listen.

Here is a non exhaustive list of topics I visited:
- Non Violent Communication (NVC)
- Mindfullness meditation
- Emotional intelligence
- Improv (theatre and danse)
- Pilates
- Cold water shower
- Resting / meditating in a sensory deprivation tank
- Cutting edge fundamental physics that is not mainstream (yet ;))
- Non religious spirituality
- (Non) Duality
- Tantra
- Other worldviews, cultural practices, philosophies, politics ..

This is my path and it doesn't have to be yours. In fact, it shouldn't be !

In the book I will share intimate details about my path or others around me as a supporting story to exhibit the underlying point: how you can use your own life to discover hidden meaning, workout your intuition and discover the next best step for you.

Thanks for reading me. I hope this caught your interest. If yes, please get in touch !
