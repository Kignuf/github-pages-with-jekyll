# Welcome

Hello, my name is Kevin Roulleau and I am a french software developper.

In this blog I will focus on self help topics and also venture into unconventional or esoterical things such as the very nature of reality, the meaning of life and so on.

Thanks for coming by and I hope you will enjoy this content !
